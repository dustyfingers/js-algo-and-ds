given a tree, how ddo you visit every node 1 (One!) time

this is a classic computer science problem!

two main ways of traversing a tree:
breadth-first search & depth-first search

bfs works across the tree, horizontally (from smallest value to largest or vice versa)
dfs works down a tree, vertically (from the root of the tree)

we will learn about both!

when to use bfs or dfs?
bfs is better for tall, NOT WIDE trees (in general)
dfs is better for wide, NOT TALL trees (in general)
