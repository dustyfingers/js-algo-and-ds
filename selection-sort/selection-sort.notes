what is selection sort?
selectino sort is similar to bubble sort,
but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values to sorted position

we start at the beginning and look for the smallest value, then put that in the front
reiterate

selection sort is better than bubble sort in that you do make less 'swaps'
so if you are in a spot where writing to memory  is extremely expensive it could be a good usecase for selection sort
