what is the big o of linear search?

const linearSearch = (arr, val, res = -1) => {
    arr.forEach((item, i) => {
        if (item === val) res = i;
    });
    return res;
}

for each item you perform a constant number of operations.
(in this case one check for value)
as n grows is this instance the number of computations grows but it grows 
by a constnant rate

linear search has a runtime that can be best described using O(n)
