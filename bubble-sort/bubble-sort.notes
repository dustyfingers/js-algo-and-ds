about bubble sort:
overall not that efficient, not that commonly used
there are use casses where it excels though!
its a good algorithm to write and optimize!

whats the idea behind bubble sort?
the largest values 'bubble' to the top!

we start with the first two items, and as we loop through the items we compare the two values
and we put the largest item (whichever we are sorting for) first
