about bubble sort:
overall not that efficient, not that commonly used
there are use casses where it excels though!
its a good algorithm to write and optimize!

whats the idea behind bubble sort?
the largest/smallest values 'bubble' to the top!

we start with the first two items, and as we loop through the items we compare the two values
and we put the largest/smallest item (whichever we are sorting for) first
