what is a singly linked list?
a linked list is a data structure, it stores anything you want
its ordered, like an array
BUT!
in an array each element is indexed, with a number usually starting at 0
whereas in a linked list have no indices on their elements...each element instead has a pointer 
to the next element (or null if its the last element)...youll see

how is it similar to the list we already know...the array!?
